"""Serial transport seam for serial/UART ESC/POS printers.

This module exposes:

* ``SerialTransport`` — Protocol with ``write(bytes)`` and ``close()``.
* ``open_serial_transport`` — factory function used by the adapter and the
  config-flow probe (``_can_connect_serial``). Accepts both filesystem paths
  (``/dev/ttyUSB0``, ``COM3``) and serialx URLs (``esphome://host:port``,
  ``rfc2217://host:port``, ``socket://host:port``).

    All ``write()`` calls are coalesced into an internal buffer and sent to
    the port in a single ``_flush()`` call when ``close()`` is invoked.
    This avoids the rapid-fire burst of tiny writes that python-escpos
    generates (one per ESC/POS attribute: bold, align, text, cut …), which
    can overrun the receive buffer on resource-constrained serial proxies
    such as an ESP32 running the ESPHome serial-proxy component.

    ``write_chunk_size`` controls how the coalesced payload is split during
    flush; ``write_chunk_delay_s`` adds a pause between consecutive chunks.
    Both default to 0, meaning the buffered payload is sent as a single
    ``port.write()`` call.
