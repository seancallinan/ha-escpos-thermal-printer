"""Shared host Protocol for printer-operation mixins.

The mixin families in this subpackage (``PrintOperationsMixin``,
``ImageOperationsMixin``, ``BarcodeOperationsMixin``,
``ControlOperationsMixin``) all need the same surface from ``self``:
the underlying connection, the per-adapter lock, the cut/feed apply
helper, etc. ``_PrinterHost`` is that contract.

B-M4: the Protocol used to live in ``print_operations.py`` and was
imported sideways by the other three mixin modules. Moving it here
puts the "what every mixin needs from its host" declaration in a
file whose name matches the role.
