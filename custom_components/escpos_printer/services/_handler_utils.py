"""Shared per-target dispatch + error-wrapping helpers for service handlers.

Every non-preview service handler iterates the resolved targets, looks
up its adapter, runs the service-specific body, and translates any
unexpected exception into a sanitised :class:`HomeAssistantError`. The
copy-paste of that skeleton across 14 handlers (Phase 1 Q-H4) was the
single largest driver of file length in ``print_handlers.py`` and the
mechanism by which ``control_handlers.py`` drifted off the
``HomeAssistantError`` re-raise + log-sanitise contract (Phase 1 Q-H3 /
Phase 2 S-H2). Centralising the loop here makes the contract a single
edit-site.
