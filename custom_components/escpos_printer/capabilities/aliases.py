"""Clone/equivalent-model aliases onto known printer profiles.

Aliases route rebadged or near-equivalent hardware to an existing
profile — almost always a bundled escpos-printer-db one, but occasionally
an integration-registered profile (see custom_profiles.py) when no bundled
profile's codepage table matches the hardware. They only ever improve
defaults (width, codepages) — they never gate behavior. Genuinely new
hardware belongs upstream in escpos-printer-db first; a custom profile is
the fallback only when upstream can't represent it (e.g. non-standard
codepage numbering).

Researched-but-held models (deliberately absent — conflicting or
unverified specs, or a widthless alias target), status as of the
2026-08-13 vendor-manual/FCC research pass (GitHub trackers were
exhausted earlier the same day — escpos-printer-db, python-escpos, and
escpos-php issues all searched):
- Zjiang ZJ-8220: a real SKU (zjiang.com product id 34), likely generic
  80mm/203dpi class, but no primary spec sheet or FCC filing found —
  zjiang.com is unreachable to fetchers (TLS cert points at sister
  domain cnfujun.com). Held at low confidence.
- PeriPage A6-class: PERMANENTLY OUT OF SCOPE — not ESC/POS at all
  (proprietary Bluetooth protocol; python-escpos #386 plus multiple
  reverse-engineering projects, e.g. eliasweingaertner/peripage-A6-
  bluetooth). Note "MTP-3" is a GOOJPRT model, not PeriPage — a
  different, unverified device; don't conflate the two.
- Symcode/Bisofice: CLOSED as unmappable at the brand level — storefront
  brands over mixed OEM hardware, no FCC identity of record; the generic
  profile is the right answer for these. Exception: a specific SKU earns
  an alias once hardware-verified via the calibration wizard (Bisofice
  XGR-POS581, issue #149 — aliased below).
(Resolved by this pass: TM-m10 — TRG-confirmed geometry, registered as
its own profile in custom_profiles.py with a borrowed-and-flagged
codepage table; Bixolon SRP-350III/352III and Citizen CT-S801/851 —
vendor-manual-confirmed geometry, aliased below.)
