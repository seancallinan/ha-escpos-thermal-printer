## Why Use This?

- Print door access logs, temperature alerts, todo lists, daily reports, or
  shopping lists automatically
- Works with any $30+ thermal printer (network, USB, Bluetooth Classic/LE, or serial)
  that supports ESC/POS
- Connects via TCP/IP, USB, Bluetooth Classic, Bluetooth LE (including via an
  ESPHome Bluetooth proxy), or a serial (UART/RS-232) cable or
  ESPHome serial proxy
- Set up as many printers as you need and target them individually or
  broadcast to all
- Direct connection to your printers, no cloud required and everything
  stays local

- Full UI configuration, no YAML required

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- **Home Assistant 2026.5 or later** (serial support needs the
  `SerialPortSelector` introduced in HA 2026.5, and the integration
  tracks HA core's bundled Pillow / dbus-fast pins; 0.4.x of this
  integration still works on HA 2024.8+ if you're stuck there)
- Thermal printer with ESC/POS support (most receipt printers)
- **Network printers:** Accessible on your network (typically port 9100)
- **USB printers:** Connected directly to your Home Assistant host (requires libusb)
- **Bluetooth Classic printers:** Linux host with kernel `AF_BLUETOOTH` support;
  printer paired on the host before adding to HA. See [Bluetooth printers](docs/bluetooth.md).
- **Bluetooth LE printers:** HA's Bluetooth integration with a connectable scanner —
  a host adapter *or* an ESPHome Bluetooth proxy. No pairing, no D-Bus, no host
  access needed. See [BLE printers](docs/ble.md).
- **Serial printers:** Linux host with serial port access (`dialout` group); or use
  an ESPHome serial proxy over the network. See [Serial printers](docs/serial.md).

### Install via HACS

This integration is in the HACS default store. No custom repository needed.

[![Open in HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=cognitivegears&repository=ha-escpos-thermal-printer&category=integration)

1. Open **HACS** in Home Assistant
2. Search for "ESC/POS Thermal Printer" and install it
3. Restart Home Assistant

### Configure Your Printer

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & services** > **Add Integration**
2. Search for "ESC/POS Thermal Printer"
3. Select your connection type:
   - **Network:** Enter your printer's IP address and port (default: 9100)
   - **USB:** Select from auto-discovered printers or enter VID:PID manually
   - **Bluetooth Classic (RFCOMM):** Pick a printer already paired on the host
   - **Bluetooth LE (GATT):** Pick a discovered BLE printer — works via Bluetooth proxy
   - **Serial (UART/RS-232):** Pick a serial port or enter a proxy URL
4. Select your printer model, or "Generic (no profile)" if it isn't listed
5. Done! Your printer is ready to use

**Note:** USB printers may be auto-discovered when connected. Check your Home
Assistant notifications.

### Automatic discovery

Every network printer setup or reconfigure asks the printer to identify
itself (ESC/POS `GS I`); Epson printers typically answer with their real
model name, which fills in the device page. Printers that don't answer are
configured exactly as before.

Epson TM-series and Rongta network printers additionally announce
recognizable DHCP hostnames; Home Assistant will offer to set them up
automatically when they appear on your network (Settings → Devices &
Services → Discovered), with the host prefilled and the matching profile
preselected. Manual setup still runs the `GS I` query, but the profile
dropdown is already on the same form when you submit it, so there's no
discovered result yet to preselect a profile from — you pick the profile
yourself, same as before. Discovered printers are tracked by MAC address, so
a DHCP lease change updates the existing entry instead of offering a
duplicate.

**Upgrading?** Printers configured before this feature pick up their
detected model the next time you run **Reconfigure** on the entry.

## Basic Examples

### Print a Message

```yaml
service: escpos_printer.print_text
data:
  text: "Hello from Home Assistant!"
  align: center
  cut: partial
```

### Print a QR Code

```yaml
service: escpos_printer.print_qr
data:
  data: "https://www.home-assistant.io"
  size: 8
  align: center
  cut: partial
```

### Target a Specific Printer

When you have multiple printers, use `target` to pick which one:

```yaml
service: escpos_printer.print_text
target:
  device_id: your_printer_device_id
data:
  text: "Sent to a specific printer"
  cut: partial
```

To print to every configured printer at once, set `broadcast: true` in `data`. (Omitting the target entirely also broadcasts, kept for backward compatibility, but logs a warning when more than one printer is configured.)

### Print a Bordered Header

```yaml
service: escpos_printer.print_box
data:
  text: DAILY REPORT
  style: auto         # → single-line ┌─┐ on CP437; ASCII otherwise
  padding: 1
  align: center
  feed: 1
```

### Print a Receipt-Style Table

```yaml
service: escpos_printer.print_table
data:
  rows:
    - ["Item", "Qty", "Price"]
    - ["Coffee", "2", "$6.00"]
    - ["Bagel",  "1", "$3.50"]
  style: single
  header: true
  column_aligns: ["left", "center", "right"]
```

### Print Receipt Totals (Label/Value Pairs)

```yaml
service: escpos_printer.print_kvtable
data:
  items:
    - ["Subtotal", "$10.00"]
    - ["Tax",      "$0.80"]
    - ["Total",    "$10.80"]
```

See the [Text effects guide](docs/text-effects.md) for the full
reference (boxes, tables, kv-tables, separators, custom-font /
rotated text via `print_text_image`, and the previewing workflow).
For ready-to-import scripts and automations see the
[Blueprints directory](blueprints/README.md).

## Supported Printers

This integration works with any printer supported by
[python-escpos](https://python-escpos.readthedocs.io/), including:

- Epson TM series (TM-T20, TM-T88, TM-U220, etc.)
- Star Micronics (TSP100, TSP650, TSP700, etc.)
- Citizen (CT-S2000, CT-S310, CT-S601, etc.)
- Most generic 58mm and 80mm thermal receipt printers

## Bluetooth (RFCOMM) printers

Cheap thermal printers (Netum, MUNBYN, POS-58 generics, Phomemo Classic line, etc.) connect over **Bluetooth Classic / RFCOMM**. Pair the printer on the host first, then add it in HA; the integration opens a raw RFCOMM socket to an already-paired device but does not handle pairing itself. Bluetooth Classic is plaintext by default, so don't route sensitive content (OTPs, 2FA codes, door logs) to a BT printer.

See [docs/bluetooth.md](docs/bluetooth.md) for the full pairing walkthrough, container deployment notes, the `socat` host-bridge fallback, and security considerations.

## Bluetooth LE (BLE) printers

BLE printers (Phomemo, cat printers, POS58-BLE and clones) connect through Home Assistant's Bluetooth integration — **no pairing, no D-Bus access, and no host shell required**. Because HA routes the connection, a BLE printer only has to be in range of *something* HA can talk to, so an ESP32 running ESPHome with `bluetooth_proxy: active: true` puts a printer anywhere in the house within reach. Like Classic, BLE is unencrypted: don't route sensitive content to it.

Note that Bluetooth proxies carry **BLE only** — a Classic/RFCOMM printer cannot be proxied.

See [docs/ble.md](docs/ble.md) for proxy setup, how to tell BLE and Classic apart, write-characteristic overrides, and chunk tuning.

## Serial (UART/RS-232) printers

For printers connected via a physical serial cable or a network-based serial proxy. Supports direct device paths (`/dev/ttyUSB0`), ESPHome UART proxies (`esphome://host:port`), RFC2217 serial servers, and raw TCP sockets. On Linux, the HA user needs to be in the `dialout` group.

See [docs/serial.md](docs/serial.md) for setup instructions, ESPHome YAML examples, write-chunking options for ESP32 buffer overruns, and troubleshooting.

## Blueprints

The [`blueprints/`](blueprints/) directory ships 13 ready-to-import Home Assistant scripts and automations that exercise the text-effects services. They cover the common day-to-day workflows so you don't need to write YAML from scratch.
