# Known Limitations

## All connection types

- **One queued operation per printer.** Each adapter holds an `asyncio.Lock`; service calls to the same printer serialize. Concurrent prints to the same device wait their turn.
- **Images auto-fit to the printer's profile width.** By default, images wider than the printer profile's maximum pixel width are resized down (with aspect ratio preserved). When you've selected a profile that doesn't expose `media.width.pixels`, the integration falls back to **384 px** (58 mm-safe; the pre-1.0 fallback of 512 px overflowed 58 mm heads), logs a `WARNING` once per adapter (check `home-assistant.log` for `does not expose media.width.pixels`), and raises a Repairs issue. The auto/default profile (no profile chosen) also uses the 384 px fallback, but silently: it has no declared width by design; on an 80 mm printer this means images print at ~2/3 paper width until you pick a profile or set `image_width: 576`. Images are never upscaled. See [How the target width is chosen](images.md#how-the-target-width-is-chosen).
- **Image files are capped at 10 MB** (both for HTTP download and for decoded base64 data URIs).
- **Image processing caps.** Decoded images cannot exceed 20 M pixels (40 M with `auto_resize`, since the source is downscaled after decode; enforced per-decode against the image header, scoped to this integration), 8192 rows of processed height, or 64 slices per print. These guard against decompression bombs and paper-DoS via tall ribbons.
- **Buffer overruns on tall images.** Chunked transmission (`fragment_height`, `chunk_delay_ms`) mitigates this; tune both per printer if you still see freezes or character dumps. Default `chunk_delay_ms` is 0 on Network / USB and 50 on Bluetooth.
- **Output is unbuffered ESC/POS**: once a print service runs, the bytes go straight to the printer. To iterate on layout without wasting paper, use the `preview_image`, `preview_box`, and `preview_table` services, which render to a PNG/TXT file instead of printing.
- **Print quality** depends on the printer's hardware density setting and paper. Not adjustable from the integration.

## Security posture (image pipeline)

The image pipeline applies meaningful but bounded defenses; deployers
should understand what is and isn't enforced. Cross-linked from
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).

- **HTTP image fetches block private and loopback addresses by
  default.** URLs resolving to RFC1918 networks, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`,
  `169.254.169.254` (cloud metadata), or other non-public ranges are
  rejected, and only ports 80/443 are allowed. Redirects are followed
  manually and re-validated. A per-printer **"Allow local image URLs"**
  option (off by default) relaxes the private/loopback block and the
  port allowlist for that printer; cloud-metadata (incl. AWS IMDSv6
  `fd00:ec2::254`), link-local, multicast, reserved, and unspecified
  addresses stay blocked regardless. Enabling it makes that printer's
  `print_image_url` an **unauthenticated LAN-reach primitive** (see the
  Trust boundary note). See
  [images.md](images.md#allowing-local--lan-urls). There is a residual
  TOCTOU window between our DNS resolution and the actual fetch; DNS
  rebinding remains a partially-mitigated threat.
- **Embedded URL credentials are rejected.** `https://user:pass@host/`
  fails validation.
- **Local file paths must lie inside `allowlist_external_dirs`.** Paths
  outside are rejected (no warn-but-read). Symlinks are dereferenced
  during validation; the actual `open()` uses `O_NOFOLLOW`.
- **Camera / image entity reads check the caller's permissions.**
  Non-admin users without `POLICY_READ` on the named entity get
  `Unauthorized`. Admins bypass entity permissions by design.
- **Error messages from failed image loads are sanitized**:
  URL credentials, filesystem paths under HA mount points, and
  Bluetooth MACs are redacted from logs.
- **Trust boundary.** Any HA user who can call `escpos_printer.print_image`
  or `notify.<printer>` can print to your physical paper roll.
  Restrict service exposure for shared installations. If a printer has
  **"Allow local image URLs"** enabled, those same callers can also make
  it fetch arbitrary LAN hosts/ports (a port-scan / SSRF oracle), so
  enable it only on printers whose callers you trust.

## Network printers

- **No keep-alive by default.** Connections reconnect per operation. Enabling Keep Alive trades latency for fragility when the printer goes offline.
- **Paper status depends on firmware.** The paper status sensor uses the real-time `DLE EOT 4` query; printers that don't answer it show the sensor as unavailable.

## USB printers

- **No persistent USB connection.** Each operation reconnects. This avoids Linux device-pinning issues but adds ~50–200ms per print.
- **Permissions required.** On bare Linux you need a udev rule. HA OS handles this automatically.
- **Container pass-through required.** Plain Docker setups need `devices: - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb` or a specific device bind.

## Bluetooth (RFCOMM) printers

- **Pair on the host first.** The integration does not initiate pairing. It only opens RFCOMM sockets to already-paired devices.
- **One client at a time.** RFCOMM is single-session. The integration auto-skips status probes during prints; aggressive `status_interval` settings hurt rather than help.
- **Plaintext over the air.** Bluetooth Classic SPP with no PIN or PIN `0000` is unencrypted. Don't route OTPs, 2FA codes, or other sensitive content to a BT printer.
- **`status_interval` floor of 60s (enforced).** Cheap BT printers beep on every connect; aggressive polling competes with in-flight prints. `0` disables polling, `1`–`59` is rejected with a form error, `60`+ is accepted.
- **Linux-only.** `AF_BLUETOOTH` is Linux-only. macOS / Windows HA installs cannot use this connection type natively.
- **Container caveats.** HA Container needs `--net=host` + `NET_ADMIN` + `NET_RAW` + `/run/dbus` mount. Or use the `socat` host-bridge fallback (see README).
- **Battery sensor only when bluez exposes it.** Most cheap thermal printers don't expose `org.bluez.Battery1`; the sensor stays unavailable for those.
- **No paper status sensor.** The Bluetooth and serial transports are write-only in this integration, and an empty status read would misreport as "plenty of paper", so those connection types don't create the sensor (network/USB only).

## Bluetooth LE (BLE) printers

- **Bluetooth proxies carry BLE only.** A Classic/RFCOMM printer cannot be reached through an ESPHome (or any other) Bluetooth proxy — that is a limitation of the proxy protocol, not this integration. A dual-mode printer can be added over BLE instead.
- **The proxy must allow connections.** ESPHome needs `bluetooth_proxy: active: true`. A passive proxy can see the printer but never print to it; such devices are hidden from the picker.
- **Proxy connection slots are finite.** An ESP32 typically supports three simultaneous connections, and the integration holds the link open between prints (default 30s) because a BLE connect costs 1-3 seconds. Lower **BLE idle disconnect** or add a proxy if slots run short.
- **Slower than every other transport.** BLE carries 20-244 bytes per packet, so large images take noticeably longer than over Classic, USB, or network.
- **Unencrypted.** Like Classic, BLE links to these printers are unauthenticated and recoverable over the air. Don't route OTPs, 2FA codes, or door logs to one. Using a proxy doesn't help — the proxy-to-printer hop is still plain BLE.
- **Some printers require bonding.** A printer can accept the connection and still reject print data with ATT 0x08 (insufficient authorization) until the link is bonded; the MTP-II family does this. The **Pair with printer** option handles it, but pairing over a Bluetooth proxy is the least reliable part of the path.
- **No standard write characteristic.** BLE has no equivalent of the Serial Port Profile. The integration auto-detects from a list of known vendor conventions and falls back to the first writable characteristic; an unusual printer may need the UUID set by hand (see [ble.md](ble.md#write-characteristic)).
- **No paper or battery sensor.** The GATT write channel is one-way, and the bluez battery interface used by Classic entries doesn't apply to proxied devices. A signal-strength sensor is provided instead (disabled by default).

## Codepage / character set

- **Not all profiles support all codepages.** The dropdown only shows codepages the selected profile advertises.
- **UTF-8 transcoding is best-effort.** `print_text_utf8` simplifies unsupported characters (curly quotes → straight, em-dash → `--`, accents stripped). Use the right codepage if you need fidelity.
