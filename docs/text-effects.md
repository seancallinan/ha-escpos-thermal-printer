# Text Effects: Boxes, Tables, and Custom-Font Text

## Your first receipt (30 seconds)

Paste this in **Developer Tools → Actions** and hit *Perform action*. If
you only have one printer configured, no `target:` is needed.

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.print_box
data:
  text: "Hello from Home Assistant!"
  style: auto
  align: center
  padding: 1
  feed: 1
```

That's it: a bordered card on paper. Read on for tables, key/value
totals, custom fonts, and the previewing workflow that lets you iterate
without burning a roll of paper.

## What's in this guide

This integration ships three services for laying out text beyond the
plain `print_text` formatting (bold / underline / multiplier sizes):

| Service | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `escpos_printer.print_box` | Wraps text in a printable border (cp437 single/double, ASCII, asterisk, hash). |
| `escpos_printer.print_table` | Multi-column rows for receipt-style layouts, optional header and inner separators. |
| `escpos_printer.print_text_image` | Renders text to a bitmap with a bundled or user-supplied TTF/OTF font; supports 0/90/180/270° rotation and any point size. |

`print_box` and `print_table` build a plain text layout and ride on
the printer's text mode; they're fast and respect the configured
codepage. `print_text_image` rasterizes the text and prints through
the same pipeline as `print_image`, so it works with **any** font /
size / rotation but takes longer than text mode.

> **Heads-up on non-ASCII text.** `print_box` and `print_table` use one
> character cell per column. CJK characters, emoji, and combining marks
> may misalign on narrow printers; see [CJK / wide-character content](#cjk--wide-character-content)
> at the bottom of this guide. For mixed-script content, prefer
> `print_text_image` (which measures actual glyph widths in pixels).

## Border styles

Both `print_box` and `print_table` accept a `style` parameter:

| Style | Looks like | Best for |
|-------|------------|----------|
| `auto` *(default)* | Adapts to codepage: single on cp437/cp850/cp852/cp858/cp860/cp863/cp865/cp866, ASCII elsewhere. | Most users; the integration picks the right glyphs for your printer. |
| `single` | `┌─┐` `│ │` `└─┘` | Receipts with cp437-family codepage. |
| `double` | `╔═╗` `║ ║` `╚═╝` | Heavier, more visually striking. |
| `ascii`  | `+-+` `\| \|` `+-+` | Any codepage; very compatible. |
| `asterisk` | `***` `* *` `***` | Decorative. |
| `hash`   | `###` `# #` `###` | Decorative. |
| `none` | (no border characters) | Borderless multi-column grids. |

**How `auto` works.** The resolver probes whether the configured
codepage can natively encode the cp437 box-drawing block. When it
can, you get crisp single-line glyphs (`┌─┐`); when it can't, you
get ASCII (`+-+`) so the printed layout still aligns column-for-
column. If you explicitly pick `single` or `double` on a codepage
that doesn't support them, the existing UTF-8 transcoder substitutes
ASCII lookalikes (single-character replacements, so column widths
stay correct).

## `escpos_printer.print_box`

Wrap a block of text in a border.

### Parameters

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `device_id` | device / [device] | *(all printers)* | Legacy target field; the standard target picker (device/entity/area/floor/label) also works. Omitting both prints to all printers (deprecated fallback, warns when several are configured). |
| `broadcast` | bool | `false` | Explicitly print to all printers, without the warning. Mutually exclusive with any target (device/entity/area/floor/label). |
| `text` | string | *(required)* | Text to wrap. Supports newlines. Up to 10 000 chars. |
| `style` | enum | `auto` | One of `auto`, `single`, `double`, `ascii`, `asterisk`, `hash`, `none`. |
| `padding` | int | `0` | Blank rows added above and below the content (0-4). |
| `align` | enum | `left` | Text alignment inside the box (`left`, `center`, `right`). |
| `total_width` | int | printer `line_width` | Total printed width in characters, *including* borders (3-200). Defaults to the printer's configured line width. |
| `cut` | enum | printer default | `none`, `partial`, `full`. |
| `feed` | int | `0` | Lines to feed after printing (0-50). |

### Examples

A bordered title on a CP437 printer:

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.print_box
data:
  text: DAILY REPORT
  style: auto         # → single-line ┌─┐ on CP437
  padding: 1
  align: center
  feed: 1
```

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                              │
│                 DAILY REPORT                 │
│                                              │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

A portable ASCII box for codepages that don't support drawing glyphs:

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.print_box
data:
  text: "Sensor alert: garage door has been open for 30 minutes."
  style: ascii
  total_width: 32
```

```text
+------------------------------+
|Sensor alert: garage door has |
|been open for 30 minutes.     |
+------------------------------+
```

Decorative banner:

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.print_box
data:
  text: "  HAPPY BIRTHDAY  "
  style: asterisk
  align: center
  padding: 1
```

## `escpos_printer.print_table`

Multi-column rows. Each row is a list of cell strings. Cells that
exceed their column width word-wrap and the row grows to the tallest
cell.

Both YAML list styles are equivalent — use whichever fits your editor.
Block style (used in the examples below):

```yaml
rows:
  - ["Item", "Qty", "Price"]
  - ["Coffee", "2", "$6.00"]
```

or inline flow style, handy for one-line fields in the UI:

```yaml
rows: [["Item", "Qty", "Price"], ["Coffee", "2", "$6.00"]]
```

The same applies to `print_kvtable`'s `items` field.

### Parameters

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `device_id` | device / [device] | *(all printers)* | Legacy target field; the standard target picker (device/entity/area/floor/label) also works. Omitting both prints to all printers (deprecated fallback, warns when several are configured). |
| `broadcast` | bool | `false` | Explicitly print to all printers, without the warning. Mutually exclusive with any target (device/entity/area/floor/label). |
| `rows` | list of lists of strings | *(required)* | The grid. First row is the header when `header: true`. Up to 200 rows × 12 cols. |
| `style` | enum | `auto` | Same options as `print_box`. `none` gives a borderless aligned grid. |
| `column_widths` | list of ints | even split | Per-column character widths. Sum + (cols+1) separators must fit `total_width`. |
| `column_aligns` | list of enums | all `left` | Per-column alignment (`left`/`center`/`right`). |
| `header` | bool | `false` | Treat the first row as a header (rule below it). |
| `row_separators` | bool | `false` | Insert a horizontal rule between every body row. |
| `total_width` | int | printer `line_width` | Total printed width in characters including borders (3-200). |
| `cut` | enum | printer default | `none`, `partial`, `full`. |
| `feed` | int | `0` | Lines to feed (0-50). |

### Examples

Receipt-style table with header and per-column alignment:

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.print_table
data:
  rows:
    - ["Item", "Qty", "Price"]
    - ["Coffee", "2", "$6.00"]
    - ["Bagel", "1", "$3.50"]
    - ["Total", "", "$9.50"]
  style: single
  header: true
  column_widths: [28, 5, 9]
  column_aligns: ["left", "center", "right"]
  total_width: 48
  feed: 2
```

```text
┌────────────────────────────┬─────┬─────────┐
│Item                        │ Qty │    Price│
├────────────────────────────┼─────┼─────────┤
│Coffee                      │  2  │    $6.00│
│Bagel                       │  1  │    $3.50│
│Total                       │     │    $9.50│
└────────────────────────────┴─────┴─────────┘
```

Borderless aligned columns (great for itemized lines without the box):

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.print_table
data:
  rows:
    - ["Coffee x2",    "$6.00"]
    - ["Bagel",        "$3.50"]
    - ["Croissant",    "$4.25"]
    - ["TOTAL",       "$13.75"]
  style: none
  column_widths: [40, 7]
  column_aligns: ["left", "right"]
```

```text
Coffee x2                                  $6.00
Bagel                                      $3.50
Croissant                                  $4.25
TOTAL                                     $13.75
```

Row-by-row separators for emphasis:

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.print_table
data:
  rows:
    - ["Time",  "Event"]
    - ["08:14", "Door opened"]
    - ["08:32", "Motion in hallway"]
    - ["09:05", "Door closed"]
  style: double
  header: true
  row_separators: true
```

## `escpos_printer.print_text_image`

Render text to a PIL bitmap with a TrueType / OpenType font, optional
rotation, and any point size, then print it through the existing
image pipeline. Unlike `print_box` and `print_table`, the output is
an image, so the printer doesn't need to support the glyphs in its
codepage. Anything that renders in the font will print.

This is the path to use for:

- Receipts in a non-Latin script the printer doesn't have a codepage for.
- Large headers / banners (rotate 90° for sideways logos along the side of the receipt).
- Decorative fonts that aren't part of the printer's built-in set.

### Bundled fonts

Three fonts ship with the integration in
`custom_components/escpos_printer/fonts/`:

| Name | File | Best for |
|------|------|----------|
| `dejavu_mono` *(default)* | DejaVuSansMono.ttf | Receipts, tabular text, code. Monospaced; aligns predictably. |
| `dejavu_sans` | DejaVuSans.ttf | Headers, banners, anywhere a proportional font reads better. |
| `dejavu_serif` | DejaVuSerif.ttf | Elegant receipts, recipe cards, long-form text. Proportional with classic letterforms. |

All three are released under the permissive DejaVu license (public-domain
modifications on top of Bitstream Vera); see the `fonts/LICENSE`
file and the repo-root `NOTICE`.

### User-supplied fonts

**The easiest way:** drop your `.ttf` / `.otf` files in
`/config/fonts/` and reference them directly. The integration
creates this directory on first setup and treats it as locally
trusted: no `configuration.yaml` edits needed.

```yaml
font_path: "/config/fonts/MyBrand-Bold.otf"
font_size: 36
```

For fonts that live anywhere else, the path must satisfy Home
Assistant's `allowlist_external_dirs` (typically `/config`,
`/media`, or `/share`). Add the parent directory to that list in
`configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  allowlist_external_dirs:
    - /share/fonts
```

When `font_path` is set, the bundled `font` field is ignored. Paths
are validated: extension is checked (`.ttf` / `.otf`), the file must
be a regular file (not a symlink target outside the trusted set),
and size is capped at 16 MB.

### Parameters

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `device_id` | device / [device] | *(all printers)* | Legacy target field; the standard target picker (device/entity/area/floor/label) also works. Omitting both prints to all printers (deprecated fallback, warns when several are configured). |
| `broadcast` | bool | `false` | Explicitly print to all printers, without the warning. Mutually exclusive with any target (device/entity/area/floor/label). |
| `text` | string | *(required)* | Text to render. Supports newlines (each newline starts a new line on the bitmap). Up to 10 000 chars. |
| `font` | enum | `dejavu_mono` | Bundled font: `dejavu_mono`, `dejavu_sans`, or `dejavu_serif`. Ignored when `font_path` is set. |
| `font_path` | string | *(unset)* | Optional path to a `.ttf` / `.otf` file inside `allowlist_external_dirs`. |
| `font_size` | int | `16` | Point size (8-96). |
| `line_spacing` | number | `1.1` | Multiplier on the font's natural line height (1.0-3.0). |
| `rotation` | enum | `0` | `0`, `90`, `180`, or `270` (clockwise). Applied to the rendered canvas before binarisation. |
| `align` | enum | `left` | Per-line alignment inside the canvas. |

The service also accepts every option from `print_image`, prefixed
with `image_` so they line up one-to-one with `print_message`'s
image-pipeline knobs: `image_width`, `image_dither`, `image_threshold`,
`image_impl`, `image_center` (YAML-only), `image_autocontrast`, `image_invert`,
`image_mirror`, `image_high_density`, `image_fragment_height`,
`image_chunk_delay_ms`. Plus the top-level `cut` and `feed`. See the
[Images guide](images.md) for what each one does. The two most
useful for text:

- `image_dither: threshold` + `image_threshold: 128` (default): crisp
  text edges. Lower (e.g. `80`) prints "thicker"; higher (`160`) prints
  "thinner". Floyd-Steinberg dithering blurs single-pixel serifs, so
  threshold mode usually wins for text.
- `font_size`: use 24-36 for headers, 12-18 for body, 48+ for
  page-fillers. Larger sizes look better at high `image_width`
  values; 128 px wide at 48 pt produces visibly blocky glyphs.

### Examples

A large bold header:

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.print_text_image
data:
  text: HEADER
  font: dejavu_sans
  font_size: 48
  align: center
  feed: 1
```

A sideways line printed along the side of the page:

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.print_text_image
data:
  text: "← TEAR HERE"
  font: dejavu_mono
  font_size: 24
  rotation: 90
```

Multi-line announcement at a non-default font:

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.print_text_image
data:
  text: |
    Garage door
    has been OPEN
    for 30 minutes
  font_path: "/config/fonts/Anton-Regular.ttf"
  font_size: 32
  align: center
  feed: 2
```

Crisp ASCII art via dither:

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.print_text_image
data:
  text: |
        /\_/\
       ( o.o )
        > ^ <
  font: dejavu_mono
  font_size: 18
  image_dither: threshold
  image_threshold: 140
```

## `escpos_printer.print_separator`

A single decorative rule built by repeating one character across the
line width. Tiny but constantly useful; visually separates
sections of a multi-call receipt.

### Examples

Single rule (default `char: "-"`):

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.print_separator
```

Heavy double rule (`=` repeated, two consecutive lines):

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.print_separator
data:
  char: "="
  repeat: 2
```

Decorative asterisk banner:

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.print_separator
data:
  char: "*"
  width: 32
```

When to use `print_separator` vs. an empty `print_box`: separators
are faster (no border rendering), single-line, and great for
chaining between other services. Boxes are richer (alignment,
padding, multi-line) but heavier.

## `escpos_printer.print_kvtable`

A focused two-column service for **label / value** rows: receipt
totals, sensor readings, ingredient lists, settings recaps. Labels
left-align; values right-align by default (typical for totals).

Behind the scenes this builds on `print_table` with `header: false`
and two columns. Use it whenever you'd otherwise hand-craft a 2-col
table.

### Examples

Receipt totals (borderless, right-aligned values):

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.print_kvtable
data:
  items:
    - ["Subtotal", "$10.00"]
    - ["Tax",      "$0.80"]
    - ["Total",    "$10.80"]
```

Result on a 48-column printer:

```text
Subtotal                                 $10.00
Tax                                       $0.80
Total                                    $10.80
```

Sensor readings (`value_align: left` for "name: value" style):

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.print_kvtable
data:
  items:
    - ["Temperature", "21.4°C"]
    - ["Humidity",    "45%"]
    - ["Pressure",    "1013 hPa"]
  value_align: left
  label_width: 14
```

Bordered totals (with `style: single`):

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.print_kvtable
data:
  items:
    - ["Subtotal", "$10.00"]
    - ["Total",    "$10.80"]
  style: single
  total_width: 28
```

## Previewing without paper

The `preview_box` and `preview_table` services run the same layout
pipeline as their `print_*` counterparts but write the rendered text
to a `.txt` file instead of sending it to the printer. Use them when
designing a layout: iterate on column widths or padding without
burning a roll.

Both services have `supports_response: only`. In Developer Tools →
**Actions**, set "Return response data" to "Show" so you see the
output path and dimensions.

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.preview_table
data:
  rows:
    - ["Item",  "Qty", "Price"]
    - ["Apple", "2",   "$1.00"]
    - ["Bread", "1",   "$3.50"]
  style: single
  header: true
  column_aligns: ["left", "right", "right"]
  output_path: /tmp/preview.txt
response_variable: preview
```

The file (`/tmp/preview.txt`) contains exactly what would print:

```text
┌────────────────┬──────┬───────┐
│Item            │ Qty  │ Price │
├────────────────┼──────┼───────┤
│Apple           │   2  │ $1.00 │
│Bread           │   1  │ $3.50 │
└────────────────┴──────┴───────┘
```

The returned `response_variable` looks like
`{path, width, line_count, codepage}`; useful for chaining a
`notify.<service>` with the rendered output.

**Workflow:** tweak `column_widths` until the preview reads right,
then change `preview_table` → `print_table` (same field set, drop
`output_path`).

## Combining services

Each service is independent: call them back-to-back from an
automation to compose a complete receipt. The printer's lock
serialises the calls so they don't interleave.

```yaml
- action: escpos_printer.print_text_image
  data:
    text: HOME ASSISTANT
    font: dejavu_serif
    font_size: 36
    align: center
    feed: 1

- action: escpos_printer.print_box
  data:
    text: "Daily Report: {{ now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d') }}"
    style: double
    align: center
    padding: 1

- action: escpos_printer.print_table
  data:
    rows:
      - ["Sensor",            "Status"]
      - ["Front door",        "Closed"]
      - ["Garage",            "Closed"]
      - ["Living room temp",  "21.4°C"]
    style: single
    header: true
    column_aligns: ["left", "right"]

- action: escpos_printer.print_separator
  data:
    char: "="
    repeat: 2

- action: escpos_printer.print_kvtable
  data:
    items:
      - ["Open issues",  "{{ states('sensor.todo_count') }}"]
      - ["Power usage",  "{{ states('sensor.daily_kwh') }} kWh"]

- action: escpos_printer.cut
  data:
    mode: full
```

See the [Blueprints directory](../blueprints/README.md) for
ready-to-import automations and scripts that use these patterns.

## Notes & limitations

- **Codepage matters for `print_box` / `print_table`.** The drawing
  glyphs are sent as ordinary text. On a non-cp437-family codepage
  (CP1252, ISO-8859-x, CJK), the existing UTF-8 transcoder swaps the
  Unicode `┌─┐` for ASCII `+-+`; column widths stay correct but the
  visual is no longer "single-line".
- **Cell width assumes 1 char = 1 column.** This is true for the
  cp437-family receipt printers this integration targets. If your
  printer treats certain glyphs (e.g. CJK) as double-width, the
  table column alignment will visually drift even though the
  underlying string is correct.
- **`print_text_image` is slower than text mode.** The bitmap path
  goes through dither + slice + chunked send. For a half-receipt of
  text this is usually a few hundred milliseconds; fine for
  automations, noticeable in tight loops.
- **`rotation` only affects `print_text_image`.** Text-mode services
  (`print_text`, `print_text_utf8`, `print_box`, `print_table`) print
  in the printer's native orientation. To rotate a table or box,
  render it through `print_text_image` instead: pass the laid-out
  table string as `text` to that service.
- **No native ESC/POS rotation.** Some printers expose `ESC V` for
  90° text rotation, but the `python-escpos` version this integration
  pins (`python-escpos==3.1`, see `pyproject.toml`) doesn't expose it;
  the image-render path is the portable substitute. If a future
  python-escpos release adds the bind, this note is the canary to
  re-evaluate the text path.

## CJK / wide-character content

Text-mode services (`print_box`, `print_table`, `print_kvtable`)
measure cell width in Python characters; they treat every codepoint
as one column. That assumption holds for Latin/Cyrillic/Greek/cp437
content, but breaks for **CJK ideographs, fullwidth punctuation, and
most emoji**, which render two terminal columns wide. The result is
silently misaligned columns: the data is correct but the visual
gridlines drift.

The **first time** `print_box`, `print_table`, or `print_kvtable`
sees wide-width characters in the input it logs a one-shot warning:

```text
Box content contains wide-width characters (CJK / fullwidth /
emoji); the borders may misalign because textwrap wraps by
code-point count, not display columns. Use print_text_image for
accurate layout; see docs/text-effects.md#cjk--wide-character-content.
(This warning fires once per process.)
```

The warning is **hint-only**; the renderer still produces output
even when wide glyphs are present, just without per-glyph column
awareness. Detection samples the first 256 characters of each
input; if the only wide glyphs appear later in a long string the
warning may not fire, but the renderer's output is identical either
way (the data is correct; only visual alignment differs).

**The recommended workaround** is to render the layout through
`print_text_image` instead: the image renderer measures actual glyph
advances (including CJK and emoji), so the columns line up visually
even if the underlying string mixes scripts. Pick `dejavu_sans` or
supply a CJK-capable font via `font_path` (e.g. Noto Sans CJK).
