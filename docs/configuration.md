# Configuration Reference

Settings that apply to all connection types. For connection-specific options, see [network.md](network.md), [usb.md](usb.md), [bluetooth.md](bluetooth.md), or [ble.md](ble.md). Don't want to set these by hand? The [calibration wizard](calibration.md) measures several of them for you by printing guided test pages.

After initial setup, click **Configure** on the integration entry to change these.

## Printer Profile

Selects your printer model from the bundled [escpos-printer-db](https://github.com/receipt-print-hq/escpos-printer-db) (~35 profiles). The profile determines available codepages, line width options, supported cut modes, and other capabilities.

- **Generic (no profile)**: works with most printers; use if your model isn't listed.
- **Custom**: type a profile name from escpos-printer-db manually.

### Rebadged and compatible printers

Many cheap thermal printers are rebadges of, or share a command set with,
an already-bundled profile. 23 such clone/equivalent models appear
directly in the profile dropdown as **"Model (compatible)"** entries — for
example, **Epson TM-T20III (compatible)**, **Xprinter XP-80C
(compatible)**, and **Citizen CT-S601II (compatible)** all route to an
existing bundled profile instead of falling back to the generic default.
Typing a model name into the **Custom** profile field also resolves known
aliases, so a bare model number works there too.

If your printer isn't listed at all, use "Generic (no profile)" and,
optionally, run the [calibration wizard](calibration.md) to measure
accurate settings for it directly — no profile required.

## Timeout

Connection timeout in seconds (default 4.0). Increase for slow networks, sleeping printers, or intermittent links. Typical 2–10s.

## Codepage

Character encoding for text. Common options:

| Codepage | Use case |
|----------|----------|
| CP437 | US English, box drawing |
| CP850 | Western European |
| CP852 | Central European |
| CP858 | Western European with € |
| CP1252 | Windows Western European |
| ISO-8859-1 | Latin-1 |
| ISO-8859-15 | Latin-9 (€) |

The dropdown only shows codepages your selected profile advertises. If special characters print wrong, try a different codepage or use the `print_text_utf8` service.

## Line Width

Characters per line:

| Width | Printer type |
|-------|--------------|
| 32 | 58mm paper, small font |
| 42 | 80mm paper, small font |
| 48 | 80mm paper, normal font |
| 64 | 80mm paper, condensed |

## Paper Width in Pixels

Optional override for the target width images are scaled to. Leave empty
to use the selected printer profile's declared width; set it when your
printer has no profile (or the profile doesn't declare a pixel width) and
images print narrower than expected — common values are 384 (58 mm) and
576 (80 mm). The [calibration wizard](calibration.md) can measure this
for you by printing a set of width-test bars. See [How the target width
is chosen](images.md#how-the-target-width-is-chosen) for the full
resolution order.

## Image Printing Implementation

Which ESC/POS image command the integration sends: **Auto** (recommended;
follows the printer profile), **Raster**, **Column**, or **Graphics**.
Override this if images print garbled, stretched, or as stray text under
the Auto setting. The [calibration wizard](calibration.md) test-prints all
three and lets you pick the one that actually rendered cleanly on your
printer. See [Reliability profile](images.md#reliability-profile) for how
this fits into the full implementation-resolution order.

## Default Alignment

Applied when a service call doesn't specify `align`: `left` (default), `center`, `right`.

## Default Cut Mode

Applied when a service call doesn't specify `cut`: `none` (default), `partial`, `full`.

## Keep Alive (network only)

Maintains a persistent TCP connection. Reduces print latency at the cost of misbehaving when the printer goes offline. **Network only.** USB, Bluetooth Classic, and serial always reconnect per operation. BLE reconnects its python-escpos object per operation too, but deliberately caches the underlying GATT link between prints — see [ble.md](ble.md#idle-disconnect).

## Status Interval

How often to probe the printer (seconds). Default is `0` (disabled) for network, USB, and Bluetooth Classic; **serial defaults to `300`** and **BLE to `60`**. A one-shot status probe still runs at startup regardless of this setting, so the binary sensor doesn't stay unknown even with periodic polling off.

- **Network**: any value works; `0` is fine for most setups since print success/failure already updates the sensor.
- **USB**: same as network; `0` is fine, since the status sensor is backed by USB device enumeration rather than a live connection.
- **Serial**: defaults to `300` seconds. Serial has no implicit health check from a paper-status poll the way network/USB do, so without periodic polling an unplugged printer would stay "Online" forever. The probe is a silent `os.stat` on the device path, so polling by default costs nothing.
- **BLE**: defaults to `60`. Its status check reads advertisement data Home Assistant has already received — no radio traffic, no connection, and the printer is never woken. It is the cheapest check of any transport, so there is no reason to make users opt in, and no minimum-interval floor.
- **Bluetooth Classic**: defaults to `0` (disabled), deliberately *not* the serial default, even though Bluetooth also lacks an implicit health check. A status check opens a real RFCOMM connection, and many cheap BT printers audibly beep on every connect; default-on polling would beep every 5 minutes. `60` or higher is accepted, and `1`–`59` is rejected with a form error. The integration auto-skips probes during prints, so aggressive polling has no benefit.

## Allow Local Image URLs

Off by default. When enabled, `print_image_url` (and the other image services) may fetch URLs that resolve to private/LAN/loopback addresses **and** use non-standard ports, e.g. a LAN camera, a Frigate proxy on `:5000`, or your Home Assistant instance on `:8123`. By default only public addresses and ports 80/443 are allowed.

Cloud-metadata (`169.254.169.254` and AWS IMDSv6 `fd00:ec2::254`), link-local, multicast, reserved, and unspecified addresses stay blocked even when this is on. The fetch carries no auth token, so only unauthenticated endpoints work.

The option is **per-printer** and is evaluated against the printer you print to. Because `print_image_url` has no per-user authorization, enabling it lets any HA user/automation reach LAN hosts/ports through that printer (an SSRF / port-scan oracle); only enable it where callers are trusted, and prefer camera/image entity sources where possible. See the [Images guide](images.md#allowing-local--lan-urls).

## Reconfiguring a printer's connection

If a printer's connection details change (a new IP address or port, a moved serial device path, a different USB port, or a re-paired Bluetooth adapter), update the existing entry instead of deleting and re-adding it:

1. **Settings → Devices & services → ESC/POS Thermal Printer**
2. Click your printer, then **Reconfigure** (in the three-dot menu of the integration entry)
3. Enter the new connection details

The entry keeps its identity, so entities, automations, blueprints, and device actions keep working. Reconfigure is for *connection* settings; print settings (profile, codepage, line width, timeouts, etc.) live under **Configure** (the options flow) as documented above. Note: USB, Bluetooth Classic, and BLE reconfiguration must point at the *same physical printer*. Re-pointing at a different device is rejected; add a new entry for a new printer.
