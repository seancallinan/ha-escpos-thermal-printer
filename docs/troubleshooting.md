## Network issues

### "Cannot connect to printer"

```bash
ping <PRINTER_IP>
telnet <PRINTER_IP> 9100   # blank screen = reachable; Ctrl+] then `quit` to exit
```

Common causes:

- Wrong IP (print a network status page from the printer itself)
- Printer in sleep mode
- Firewall blocking port 9100
- Printer on a different subnet

Fixes: increase the timeout (try 8–10s), assign a static IP, verify port 9100.

### Connection works sometimes

DHCP lease churn or sleep mode. Assign a static IP, disable sleep, optionally enable Keep Alive.

### "Connection refused"

Another app is using the printer, or it's in an error state (paper out, cover open). Power-cycle.

### Printer not auto-discovered

Discovery only matches DHCP hostnames starting with `tm-` (Epson TM-series)
or `rongta_` (Rongta). Other brands and clones aren't matched: add them
manually by IP address instead. `tm-*` hostnames also have to answer an
ESC/POS `GS I` identity query before the discovery card appears, so an
Epson printer with that query disabled won't show up either. Disabled
hostname broadcast on the printer, or the printer sitting on a separate
VLAN/subnet from Home Assistant, also prevents discovery: DHCP snooping is
LAN-local and can't cross those boundaries.

### Device page shows "ESC/POS / Network Printer" instead of my model

The printer didn't answer the `GS I` identity query at setup (or
reconfigure) time. Most non-Epson clones don't implement it. This is
harmless: identification is cosmetic and every printing feature still
works. Epson owners can retry via **Reconfigure**. Brand-hostname clones
(e.g. Rongta) are identified by their announced DHCP hostname even
though their firmware's `GS I` reply claims to be an Epson.

## USB issues

### "Permission denied" / "Access denied"

On bare Linux, add a udev rule:

```bash
# /etc/udev/rules.d/99-escpos.rules
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="04b8", MODE="0666"
```

Replace `04b8` with your vendor ID. Reload:

```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

In Docker: pass the device through (`/dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb`).

### "Device not found"

```bash
lsusb | grep -i printer
```

Try a different cable / port. Verify the printer is powered on.

### "Input/Output Error" (errno 5)

libusb's generic I/O error: usually USB autosuspend or another driver holds the device.

Fixes:

- Replug the printer.
- Disable USB autosuspend:

  ```bash
  echo -1 > /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb*/power/autosuspend
  ```

- Stop other apps holding the device (CUPS, lp drivers).

### "USB backend missing"

libusb not installed. HA OS includes it. On bare Linux: `sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0`. In Docker: ensure libusb is in your image.

### Wrong endpoints

```bash
lsusb -v -d VENDOR:PRODUCT | grep Endpoint
```

Look for `bEndpointAddress`. Defaults are `0x82` (in) and `0x01` (out).

### Printer not auto-discovered

Vendor ID isn't in the known list. Use **Browse all USB devices** or **Manual entry** with VID:PID.

## Bluetooth Classic (RFCOMM) issues

### Error key reference

| Error key | Likely cause | Action |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| `bt_unavailable` | Kernel `AF_BLUETOOTH` not reachable (HA Container without `--net=host`) | Add `network_mode: host` to compose; or use `socat` host-bridge fallback |
| `bt_permission_denied` | HA process can't open BT socket | Add HA user to `bluetooth` group on bare Linux |
| `bt_device_not_found` | Printer never paired, or pairing was removed | Pair on host first (see [bluetooth.md](bluetooth.md#one-time-pairing)) |
| `bt_host_down` | Powered off, out of range, already connected to another host | Power on, bring closer, disconnect other host |
| `bt_timeout` | Printer asleep: first probe missed | Print once to wake, or increase timeout |
| `bt_channel_refused` | Wrong RFCOMM channel | Use 1; confirm via `bluetoothctl info <MAC>` |
| `cannot_connect_bt` | Catchall (errno not recognized) | Check HA debug logs |
| `invalid_bt_mac` | MAC format invalid | Use `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF` (uppercase, colons) |
| `invalid_rfcomm_channel` | Channel out of range | Must be 1–30 (almost always 1) |

## Bluetooth LE (BLE) issues

### Error key reference

| Error key | Likely cause | Action |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| `ble_no_bluetooth` | HA's Bluetooth integration isn't set up | Add a Bluetooth adapter, or an ESPHome proxy with `active: true` |
| `ble_no_scanners` | No adapter or proxy is currently online, so nothing can reach any BLE device | Check your Bluetooth proxies are powered on and reachable. Look for `aioesphomeapi ... Can't connect` in the log |
| `ble_not_found` | Printer out of range of every connectable scanner, or not advertising | Power it on; move a proxy closer. Many portable models advertise only for a few minutes after power-on |
| `ble_connect_failed` | Already connected to a phone, at range edge, or the proxy is out of connection slots | Disconnect the other client; lower **BLE idle disconnect**; add a second proxy |
| `ble_no_write_char` | Device exposes nothing writable — probably not an ESC/POS printer | If you're sure it is, set the write characteristic UUID manually |
| `ble_needs_pairing` | Printer accepted the connection but refused the data with ATT 0x08 (insufficient authorization) — its write characteristic requires a bonded link | Check signal strength first: a weak link produces this spuriously. If the signal is good, enable **Pair with printer** in the entry's reconfigure form |
| `cannot_connect_ble` | Catchall | Check HA debug logs |
| `invalid_ble_address` | Address format invalid | Use `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF` |
| `invalid_ble_uuid` | Characteristic UUID malformed | Use the 128-bit form or 16-bit shorthand (`ff02`) |

### Printer missing from the BLE picker

Choose **Show all discovered BLE devices...** — the default view filters to printer-like
names, and plenty of printers advertise something generic.

If it's still absent, the only scanner that can see it is passive. An ESPHome Bluetooth proxy
must be configured with:

```yaml
bluetooth_proxy:
  active: true
```

Non-connectable sightings are deliberately hidden, because a printer you can see but can never
open a connection to would only fail later.

### BLE prints start fine then turn to garbage

Unacknowledged BLE writes have no backpressure — the printer can't tell you to slow down, it
just drops bytes. In order of effectiveness:

1. Raise **BLE write delay (ms)** (default 20) in the options flow.
2. Set **Write acknowledgement** to *Always acknowledged*.
3. Select the **BLE-safe** reliability profile (small image slices, long per-slice wait).

### All BLE operations fail at once

If every BLE action started failing together, check the proxies before the printer. In the HA
log, look for:

```text
[aioesphomeapi.reconnect_logic] Can't connect to ESPHome API for <proxy> @ <ip>: [Errno 113]
```

`Errno 113` is `EHOSTUNREACH` — Home Assistant has no network route to the proxy. If several
ESPHome devices report it at the same timestamp, it's a host/network problem, not Bluetooth:
check the HA host's networking (especially container networking and VLAN routing), then the
proxies themselves.

Home Assistant caches discovered BLE devices for a while, so a printer can still *appear*
configured and reachable for a period after its only proxy has gone offline. The integration
reports this as `ble_no_scanners` once it notices the scanner pool is empty.

### BLE print fails with "Insufficient authorization (8)"

The printer accepted the connection and the characteristic resolved fine — it is refusing the
*data* because the link is not bonded. Reconfigure the entry and enable **Pair with printer**.

Bonding over an ESPHome proxy is the least reliable part of the BLE path (the proxy carries the
exchange and stores the bond on the ESP32, which has few bond slots). If it still fails, the
printer likely needs a host Bluetooth adapter, or Bluetooth Classic if it is dual-mode.

### Print succeeds, no error, but no paper comes out

**Check `feed` before anything else.** Printers without an auto-cutter — which is most portable
BLE and Bluetooth Classic models — only advance paper when you ask them to, and `print_text`,
`print_text_utf8`, `print_qr` and `print_barcode` all default to `feed: 0`. The result is that
everything prints inside the mechanism, on top of itself, and nothing emerges. There is no error
because the bytes were delivered successfully.

Pass `feed: 2` or higher:

```yaml
action: escpos_printer.print_text
data:
  text: Hello
  feed: 3
```

Printers with a cutter don't show this, because the cut advances the paper for you.

### BLE printer connects but nothing prints

Auto-detection picked the wrong characteristic — usually a vendor control channel rather than
the data channel. Download diagnostics for the entry (**⋮ → Download diagnostics**); the dump
lists every characteristic, which are writable, and which are recognised printer UUIDs. Set the
right one via **Write characteristic UUID** in the reconfigure form.

See [ble.md](ble.md) for the full BLE guide.

### "Bluetooth not available"

Kernel `AF_BLUETOOTH` socket family isn't reachable from the HA process.

- HA Container without `--net=host`: add to compose.
- Rootless Docker / Podman: bluez D-Bus EXTERNAL auth fails across UID namespaces. Use the `socat` host-bridge fallback.
- Non-Linux host: `AF_BLUETOOTH` is Linux-only. Use a network printer or the `socat` bridge.

### Status flaps online/offline

Most BT thermal printers sleep aggressively. Each RFCOMM connect takes 1–3s. Set **Status check interval** to 60s+ (or 0). Verify pairing is intact:

```bash
bluetoothctl info AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
# Look for "Paired: yes" and "Trusted: yes"
```

If the printer was factory-reset or its battery fully drained, the link key may be invalid. Re-pair:

```bash
bluetoothctl
[bluetooth]# remove AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
[bluetooth]# pair AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
[bluetooth]# trust AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

### Paired-device list empty in config flow

D-Bus not reachable, or printer simply not paired:

```bash
bluetoothctl paired-devices  # on the host
```

If your printer shows there but not in HA, the HA process can't reach the system D-Bus. On HA Container, add `/run/dbus:/run/dbus:ro` to volume mounts.

### Useful host-side commands

```bash
bluetoothctl paired-devices         # confirm pairing
bluetoothctl info AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF # show service records (channel)
sudo dmesg -w | grep -i bluetooth   # live BT events
sudo rfcomm connect 0 AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF 1  # manual RFCOMM probe
```

## Serial issues

### "Permission denied accessing serial port"

Add the HA user to the `dialout` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout homeassistant
```

Restart Home Assistant. In Docker, also pass the device through (`--device /dev/ttyUSB0`).

### "Serial port not found"

Verify the path exists on the host:

```bash
ls /dev/ttyUSB* /dev/ttyACM*
```

For ESPHome/RFC2217 URLs, confirm the remote device is online and the port number matches your ESPHome configuration.

### "Serial port is busy"

Another process holds the port. Common culprits: **ModemManager** (`sudo systemctl disable --now ModemManager`) and **brltty**. A udev rule can prevent them from claiming the adapter:

```bash
# /etc/udev/rules.d/99-escpos-serial.rules
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="<VID>", ATTRS{idProduct}=="<PID>", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"
```

### Garbled or truncated output (ESPHome / ESP32)

The ESP32 UART FIFO is overflowing. Enable write chunking in **Settings → Devices & services → ESC/POS Thermal Printer → Configure**: set **Write chunk size** to `128` and **Inter-chunk delay** to `10` ms.

See [serial.md](serial.md) for the full setup guide, ESPHome YAML, and detailed troubleshooting.

## Print-quality problems

The [calibration wizard](calibration.md) can usually diagnose and fix wrong or mangled accented text — see calibration.md.

- **Garbled characters**: codepage mismatch. Try CP437, CP850, or use `print_text_utf8`.
- **Special characters missing**: printer codepage doesn't support them. Use `print_text_utf8` for best-effort transliteration.
- **Text wraps wrong**: line width setting wrong. 32 for 58mm paper, 42–48 for 80mm.
- **Print too light/dark**: printer hardware setting. Not controllable from the integration.

## Service errors

- **"Service not found"**: restart HA; verify the integration loaded.
- **"No valid ESC/POS printer targets found"**: wrong device ID, or entry not loaded. Use `broadcast: true` to send to all printers.
- **"no target specified — printing to all N configured printers" warning**: a service call with multiple printers configured named no target. This implicit broadcast fallback is deprecated and will be removed in 2.0.0 — select a target (device, entity, area, floor, or label) to print to one printer, or set `broadcast: true` if printing everywhere is intended.
- **"Printer configuration not found"**: entry was removed. Restart HA or re-add.
- **Timeout errors during printing**: increase timeout, reduce image size, check network.

## Image issues

The [calibration wizard](calibration.md) can usually diagnose and fix garbled image output or wrong image width — see calibration.md.

- **"Image too large"**: the source file exceeds the 10 MB cap (40 MB with `auto_resize: true`), or the decoded image exceeds 20 M pixels. Re-export at lower resolution/quality, or set `auto_resize: true`. Width is fitted to the printer automatically and is not the cause of this error.
- **Image doesn't print**: use PNG or JPEG; for URLs verify reachable from HA host; for local files use absolute paths starting with `/config/`.
- **Image prints solid black**: image is too dark or has alpha issues. Use white background, increase contrast, convert to 1-bit B&W.
- **Image prints garbled, stretched, or half-width**: see [Images troubleshooting](images.md#troubleshooting) for the `impl` and paper-width remedies.

## Paper and cutting

- **Paper doesn't cut**: verify the printer has an auto-cutter. Try `partial` instead of `full`.
- **Partial cut leaves too much attached**: normal; use `full` if you need a cleaner cut.
- **Paper jams during cutting**: wrong paper width, debris in cutter, or low-grade paper.

## Debug logging

Add to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.escpos_printer: debug
    escpos: debug
```

Restart HA. View at **Settings → System → Logs**, or:

```bash
ha core logs | grep escpos             # HA OS
docker logs homeassistant 2>&1 | grep escpos  # Docker
```

## Printer-specific notes

- **Epson TM series**: verify ESC/POS mode (not Epson proprietary). Check DIP switches.
- **Star Micronics**: verify ESC/POS emulation (not Star native mode). Check the printer's web interface.
- **Generic / unbranded**: use **Generic (no profile)**. Try CP437 first, or run the [calibration wizard](calibration.md) to measure working settings directly. Some cheap printers don't support all ESC/POS commands (QR codes, beep, cut).
