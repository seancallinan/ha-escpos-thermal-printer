# Development Guide

This guide covers how to set up a development environment, run tests, and contribute to the project.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13.2 or later
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager (recommended) or pip
- Git
- Docker (optional, for local Home Assistant testing)

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cognitivegears/ha-escpos-thermal-printer.git
cd ha-escpos-thermal-printer
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Using uv (recommended):

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

Or using pip:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### 3. Install Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
pre-commit install
```

This sets up automatic linting and formatting checks before each commit.

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests

```bash
uv run pytest -q
```

Or without uv:

```bash
pytest -q
```

### Run a Specific Test File

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_services_text.py -v
```

### Run Integration Tests

Integration tests are excluded by default. To run them:

```bash
uv run pytest -m integration
```

### Run with Coverage

```bash
uv run pytest --cov=custom_components/escpos_printer --cov-report=html
```

## Linting and Type Checking

### Run Ruff (Linter)

```bash
uv run ruff check .
```

Auto-fix issues:

```bash
uv run ruff check . --fix
```

### Run Mypy (Type Checker)

```bash
uv run mypy custom_components/escpos_printer
```

### Run All Pre-commit Checks

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Local Testing with Home Assistant

### Using Docker Compose

The easiest way to test the integration locally is with Docker:

```bash
# Start Home Assistant (runs at http://localhost:8123)
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop and remove container
docker compose down
```

The Docker setup mounts `custom_components/` into the container. Changes to your code are reflected after restarting Home Assistant.

Once running:

1. Open <http://localhost:8123>
2. Complete the onboarding wizard
3. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & services** > **Add Integration**
4. Search for "ESC/POS Thermal Printer"

## Project Structure

The integration lives under `custom_components/escpos_printer/`. Major subpackages:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `__init__.py` | Integration setup, `EscposRuntimeData`, `async_setup_entry`/`async_unload_entry` |
| `_config_flow/` | Multi-step config flow (network, USB, Bluetooth, settings, options, import) |
| `printer/` | Adapter implementations: base, network, USB, Bluetooth (RFCOMM), shared print/barcode/control operations, factory, configs |
| `services/` | Service registration + handlers (print, control, target resolution) |
| `device_action/` | Device-action triggers exposed to automations |
| `capabilities/` | Printer profile / codepage / line-width capability data |
| `text_utils/` | UTF-8 transcoding + lookalike/accent fallback tables |
| `binary_sensor.py` | Printer-online connectivity entity |
| `sensor.py` | Bluetooth battery sensor |
| `notify.py` | HA notify entity + `print_message` entity service |
| `diagnostics.py` | Diagnostics dump for support tickets |
| `security.py` | Input validation (text, URLs, paths, numerics) |
| `bluez.py` | Bluez D-Bus helpers (paired-device enumeration, battery query) |
| `const.py` | Domain, config keys, defaults, vendor IDs |
| `manifest.json` | Integration metadata + `quality_scale` declaration |
| `services.yaml` | Service definitions surfaced to HA |
| `icons.json` | Service + entity icon registry |
| `quality_scale.yaml` | HA quality-scale rule audit |
| `strings.json` / `translations/` | UI strings + translations |

For the live tree, run:

```bash
tree custom_components/escpos_printer -L 2 -I "__pycache__"
```

Tests live under `tests/` (unit) and `tests/integration_tests/` (HA-runtime). Utility scripts in `scripts/` (manifest sync, version check). User documentation in `docs/`.

## Key Patterns

### Async I/O

All printer operations run on executor threads to avoid blocking the Home Assistant event loop:

```python
await hass.async_add_executor_job(blocking_function, arg1, arg2)
```

### Service Registration

Services are registered globally once (not per config entry) and resolve device targets at runtime. See `services.py` for the implementation.

### Security Validation

All user input is validated before reaching the printer. See `security.py` for validation functions.

### Printer Adapters

The integration uses a factory pattern for printer adapters:

- `EscposPrinterAdapterBase` - Abstract base class defining the interface
- `NetworkPrinterAdapter` - TCP/IP network connections
- `UsbPrinterAdapter` - Direct USB connections
- `create_printer_adapter()` - Factory function that instantiates the correct adapter

Both adapters implement identical operations, allowing services to work transparently with either connection type.

## Dependency Management

- **pyproject.toml** is the source of truth for all dependencies
- **manifest.json** must mirror runtime dependencies
- Use exact version pins (e.g., `==1.2.3`) for reproducible builds
- Renovate automatically updates dependencies

### Syncing manifest.json

If you add or update dependencies in pyproject.toml:

```bash
python scripts/sync_manifest_requirements.py
```

### Checking for Drift

```bash
python scripts/check_requirements_sync.py
```

## Making Changes

### Before Submitting a PR

1. Run the full test suite: `uv run pytest -q`
2. Run linting: `uv run ruff check .`
3. Run type checking: `uv run mypy custom_components/escpos_printer`
4. Run pre-commit: `pre-commit run --all-files`
5. Update documentation if needed

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

- `Add support for printer model X`
- `Fix connection timeout handling`
- `Update dependencies`

### Code Style

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Add docstrings for public functions

## Contributing printer profiles

You don't need to write code to help: the easiest way to contribute
printer data is the [calibration wizard](docs/calibration.md)'s share
link. Run the wizard against your printer (Settings → Devices & services
→ your printer entry → Configure → "Calibrate printer (prints test
pages)"), and its summary step builds a prefilled GitHub issue containing
your measured results and a draft `escpos-printer-db` profile entry.
Submitting it helps every future owner of that printer model get accurate
defaults instead of falling back to generic settings.

## Testing Without a Physical Printer

The test suite uses mocks for all printer operations. You don't need a physical printer to run tests or develop features.

For manual testing, you can:

1. Use a virtual printer emulator (see `tests/integration_tests/`)
2. Connect a real printer to your network or via USB
3. Use the binary sensor to verify connectivity without printing

**Note:** USB discovery functions are mocked in tests. To test USB functionality manually, connect a real USB printer.

## Troubleshooting Development Issues

### Import Errors

If you see import errors, make sure you've installed in development mode:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

### Pre-commit Failures

If pre-commit fails, try updating the hooks:

```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
pre-commit run --all-files
```
